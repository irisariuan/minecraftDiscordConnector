# Plugin Upload Web UI

A web interface for uploading custom plugins to the Minecraft server managed by the Discord bot. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and integrated with the bot's upload server.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Easily upload plugin files by dragging and dropping or selecting from your device.
- **Token-Based Access**: Secure uploads using tokens generated by the Discord bot.
- **File Validation**: Accepts specific file types (.jar, .yaml, .yml, .conf, .zip) with size limits.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS styling.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays upload progress, errors, and success states.

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BaseLayout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸš€ Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |

## Integration with Discord Bot

This web UI is served by the Discord bot's Express server. To use it:

1. Run the `/uploadplugin` command in Discord to generate an upload token.
2. Access the provided URL with the token to upload your plugin.
3. The bot handles file processing and server integration.
